	<other>Summoning air elementals. Five aarakocra within 30ft of each other can magically summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have done finished their third turn of the dance, the air elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60ft of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short  rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5ft of it can return with it.</other>
