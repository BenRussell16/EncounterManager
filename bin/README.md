# EncounterManager
A tool for building and managing encounters for 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

This tool is intended for personal use, and I in no way claim ownership of most of the content.
The spells and monsters included are (almost all) property of Wizards of the Coast, and specific sources will be included with the information.
I personally own copies of the source books, and produced this simply to give myself a localised list to reduce time and effort needed to prepare sessions for my group.

Features.
 - Spell lists. This system has a form fillable spell list, for adding spells in a standardized format. This list contains all the spells I have access to.
 - Spell books. This system has a window for building known and prepared spell lists for a creature using the complete list of spells stored in the system, which also includes spell slot tracking. This window also includes inputs for daily use spells such as innate racial casting.
 - Creature lists. There is a form fillable creature builder which creates them in a standardized format just like the spell builder. The inputs for this form include a set of common passive abilities to make creature building easier, and all of the languages and subtypes in the monster manual. The creature builder also connects to the spellbook system making a creatures spell management simple.
 - Encounter builder. The next section included in this project uses the stored list of creatures to help users build and balance encounters. In this window you can compile a list of creatures, and a list of character levels with a variety of multiplier sets, to give hard numbers to XP values and the corresponding difficulties.
 - Free filtering. As the creatures, and spells, have a standardized format based on sets of options rather than free inputs, we can freely filter by almost any value.
