# EncounterManager
A tool for building and managing encounters for 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

This tool is intended for personal use, and I in no way claim ownership of most of the content.
The spells and monsters included are (almost all) property of Wizards of the Coast, and specific sources will be included with the information.
I personally own copies of the source books, and produced this simply to give myself a localised list to reduce time and effort needed to prepare sessions for my group.
