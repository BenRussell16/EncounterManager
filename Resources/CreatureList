		<effect>Weapon Invention,null,The kobold uses one of the following options (roll a d8 or choose one); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:
1. Acid. The kobold hurls a flask of acid. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.
2. Alchemist's Fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.
4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined 5-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.
5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.
6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can't take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.
8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</effect>

3			Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.
4			Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.
5			Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.
6			Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.
7			Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.
8			Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.
9			Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).
10			Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.

CLOCKWORK MALFUNCTIONS
d10			Malfunction
1			Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.
2			Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.
3			Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.
4			Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.
5			Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.
6			Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its
turn.
7			Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues
fighting.
8			Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.
9			Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.

	<other>MAJOR ADAPTATIONS
d8	Major Adaptation
1	Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage (category 1), 4 (1d8) acid damage (category 2), or 6 (1d12) acid damage (category 3).
2	Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor
Class by 4.
3	Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
4	Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
5	Crabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is grappled (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature grappled in this way at a time.
6	Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5- 6) . As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around
itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours.
7	Venomous Sting. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws , the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the krasis is a category 2 or 3, the creature is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
8	Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.

MINOR ADAPTATIONS
d8	Minor Adaptation
1	Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
2	Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.
3	Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.
4	Cryptic Skin. The krasis can change color to match its surroundings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
5	Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be surprised, as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes.
6	Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud.
7	Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3).
8	Stabilizing Legs. The krasis has several crablike legs. As a result, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.</other>

The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6: lf the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.</effect>
		<effect>Body Thief,null,The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. lt otherwise adopts the target's statistics. lt knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.
lf the host body drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.</effect>

MADNESS SEVERITY
Failed Saves	Madness
1			Short-term
2-3			Long-term
4+			Indefinite

PRIMARY FEATURES
d4	Feature
1	Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
2	Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
3	Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
	3/day: darkness
	1/day each:fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only).
4	Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror).

SECONDARY FEATURES
d4	Feature
1	Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror.
	As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the horror. The DC of the saving throw and the DC to escape the grapple are the same: 9 for the flying horror, 13 for the shadow horror, and 19 for the skittering horror. Until the grapple ends, the horror can't use the same tendril to grapple another target.
2	Indomitable Mind. The horror is immune to the charmed condition.
3	Keen Senses. The horror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, sound, or smell.
4	Mind Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the horror's darkvision.</other>

		<effect>Frightening Screech,Recharge 5-6,The horror screeches. Each creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the horror's Frightening Screech for the next 24 hours.</effect>

	<other>Gunpowder by the keg.
Aside from their personal gunpowder weapons, giff ships and mercenary companies carry spare gunpowder in kegs. In an emergency, or any time a large explosion is needed, a whole keg can be detonated. A giff lights the fuse on the keg and can then throw the keg up to 15 feet as part of the same action. The keg explodes at the start of the giff's next turn. Each creature within 20 feet of the exploding keg must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 24 (7d6) fire damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
Every other keg of gunpowder within 20 feet of an exploding keg has a 50 percent chance of also exploding. Check each keg only once per turn, no matter how many other kegs explode around it.</other>

CLOCKWORK ENHANCEMENTS
d10			Enhancement
1			Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.
2 			Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet , unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.
3			Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.
4			Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.
5			Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.
6			Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.
7			Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.
8			Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.
9			Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).
10			Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.

CLOCKWORK MALFUNCTIONS
d10			Malfunction
1			Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.
2			Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.
3			Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.
4			Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.
5			Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.
6			Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its
turn.
7			Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues
fighting.
8			Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.
9			Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.
10			Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</other>

		<attack>Bite,5,5,One target. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect:
1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.
2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.
3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.</attack>

CLOCKWORK ENHANCEMENTS
d10			Enhancement
1			Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.

4			Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.
5			Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.
6			Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.
7			Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.
8			Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.
9			Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).
10			Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.

CLOCKWORK MALFUNCTIONS

4			Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.
5			Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.
6			Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its
turn.
7			Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues
fighting.
8			Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.
9			Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.

The cloud spreads around corners and remains until one of the Golgari dismisses it as an action, the Golgari group uses this lair action again, or all the members of the Golgari group die. The area within the cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.</lairaction>
		<lairaction>Tendrils of creeping fungi reach out to ensnare the enemies of the Golgari. The Golgari choose a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 60 feet of any member of the group. Each creature in the area that isn't allied with the Golgari group must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the Golgari group uses this lair action again, all the members of the group are slain, or no member of the group is within 60 feet of the effect. A creature restrained in this way can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the restrained effect on itself with a success.</lairaction>

CLOCKWORK ENHANCEMENTS
d10			Enhancement
1			Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.
2 			Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet , unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.
3			Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.
4			Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.
5			Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.
6			Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.
7			Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.
8			Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.
9			Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).
10			Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.

CLOCKWORK MALFUNCTIONS
d10			Malfunction
1			Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.
2			Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.
3			Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.
4			Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.
5			Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.
6			Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its
turn.
7			Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues
fighting.
8			Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.
9			Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.
10			Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</other>

	<other>MAJOR ADAPTATIONS
d8	Major Adaptation
1	Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage (category 1), 4 (1d8) acid damage (category 2), or 6 (1d12) acid damage (category 3).
2	Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor
Class by 4.
3	Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
4	Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
5	Crabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is grappled (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature grappled in this way at a time.
6	Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5- 6) . As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around
itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours.
7	Venomous Sting. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws , the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the krasis is a category 2 or 3, the creature is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
8	Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.

MINOR ADAPTATIONS
d8	Minor Adaptation
1	Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
2	Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.
3	Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.
4	Cryptic Skin. The krasis can change color to match its surroundings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
5	Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be surprised, as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes.
6	Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud.
7	Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3).
8	Stabilizing Legs. The krasis has several crablike legs. As a result, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.</other>

		<effect>Back to Earth,null,The Source focuses its gaze on an enemy within 30 feet. If the target's body is made of flesh, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. At the end of its next turn, it must repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</effect>
		<effect>Wall of Stone,1/Day,The Source causes a 30-foot-long wall of solid stone to thrust up through the floor. The wall has six 5-foot-long panels to it, which can be arranged however the summoner of the Source wishes, but each segment must form a line or a right angle with the previous segment. Each panel is 6 inches thick and 10 feet high. Each panel has AC 15 and 180 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points, a panel crumbles, leaving loose scree that counts as difficult terrain. The wall lasts for 10 minutes, then turns to dust.
If the wall is summoned in a creature's space, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall, chosen by the summoner. If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</effect>

If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.</effect>

PRIMARY FEATURES
d4	Feature
1	Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
2	Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
3	Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
	3/day: darkness
	1/day each:fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only).
4	Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror).

The archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.
While in a new form, the archdruid retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks . It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form.
The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.</effect>

PRIMARY FEATURES
d4	Feature
1	Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
2	Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
3	Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3	Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
4	Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
5	Crabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is grappled (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature grappled in this way at a time.
6	Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5- 6) . As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around
itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours.
